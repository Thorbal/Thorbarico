# Polaris
A multiplatform Python bot using plugins!
It's still in development right now, so you may get crashes and features
may not be fully implemented or can suddenly disappear. 
If you find a bug or have any cool idea feel free to [open an Issue](https://github.com/luksireiku/polaris/issues/new).

Please read the [Wiki](https://github.com/luksireiku/polaris/wiki) to get some help installing and setting it up.
